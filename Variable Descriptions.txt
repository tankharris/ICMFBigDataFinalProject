# Academic Reputation

The Academic Reputation indicator is calculated through a multi-step process that begins with a worldwide survey of academics. Academics are asked to nominate universities they believe excel in their subject area, and around 7000 institutions are evaluated each year. The process starts by collecting responses from a variety of sources such as previous respondents, institutional contact lists, sign-ups, and external databases. Each nomination is then given a weighted count that reflects the source’s regional and country-level expertise as well as the year the response was submitted.

The first component of the calculation is the International Weighted Count. This involves assigning weights to nominations based on the respondent’s familiarity with the region or academic discipline and the recency of the nomination. Nominations are aggregated over the past five years, with the most recent three years receiving full weight, the fourth year half weight, and the fifth year only 25% weight. This structure ensures that the most current views on academic excellence have the greatest influence.

In addition to the international score, a Domestic Weighted Count is computed. This score is based on domestic nominations—excluding any self-nominations—and is adjusted according to the number of institutions in a given country and the overall volume of responses from that country. This adjustment accounts for the fact that institutions in larger countries face more competition and helps ensure that nominations from less populous or less represented areas are fairly considered.

After both domestic and international weighted counts are determined, normalization and transformation techniques are applied. Both scores are normalized to a scale of 0 to 100, and then they are combined using predefined weightings to create a composite score. Transformation methods are also used to minimize the impact of any outliers and to ensure that the final score accurately reflects the collective academic judgment.

# Employer Reputation

The Employer Reputation indicator measures the standing of an institution among employers worldwide by capturing and analyzing employer feedback through a dedicated survey. Employers across the globe are asked to nominate universities based on how well they believe the institution’s graduates are prepared for the workforce. This indicator is unique in that it focuses on the critical factor of employability, which is particularly relevant as most undergraduates seek employment after graduation.

The calculation begins with collecting responses to the Employer Survey. Similar to the Academic Reputation indicator, the process involves aggregating nominations from both international and domestic sources. For the international component, a weighted count is computed where each nomination is adjusted based on several factors. These include regional familiarity—ensuring that responses from over-represented areas do not skew the results—and country familiarity, which adjusts for the varying number of institutions and participation rates in different countries. Additionally, the survey uses a five-year window of responses: nominations from the most recent three years receive full weight, the fourth year is weighted at 50%, and the fifth year contributes 25% to the overall count.

Parallel to this, a domestic weighted count is calculated. This count specifically looks at nominations from employers within the same country as the institution, with self-nominations excluded to prevent bias. The domestic count is then adjusted against the number of institutions within that country that have received international nominations and the total volume of responses. This adjustment is crucial because it levels the playing field for institutions in countries with a larger number of competing universities.

Once both the international and domestic weighted counts are determined, they are normalized to a common scale of 0 to 100. Transformation techniques are then applied to minimize the impact of outlier values and to ensure that the final score accurately reflects the reputation of the institution among employers. 

Faculty Student

The Faculty-Student Ratio indicator is designed to measure the number of academic staff available to teach and support students at an institution. It is calculated by dividing the number of full-time equivalent (FTE) faculty staff—comprising both teaching and research personnel—by the number of full-time equivalent students, which includes both undergraduate and postgraduate learners. The rationale behind this indicator is that a higher ratio, meaning more academic staff per student, generally correlates with a better learning experience. This is because additional staff can provide enhanced teaching, supervision, curriculum development, and pastoral support. Data for this indicator is gathered from two main sources: institutions themselves, through data submissions as part of the research process, and third-party sources such as government ministries and agencies like the UK Higher Education Statistics Agency. The collected data is cross-verified across multiple sources to ensure accuracy. Moreover, when calculating FTE, part-time staff or students are standardized by using the formula Full-time + (Part-time/3) to allow for a fair comparison across different institutions regardless of their operational models.


Citations per Faculty

The Citations per Faculty indicator is designed to measure the intensity and impact of research performed by an institution's academic staff by assessing the average number of citations received per faculty member. This indicator takes the total citation count from papers published over a designated five-year period, evaluated over a six-year citation window, and divides it by the number of faculty members, thereby normalizing for differences in institutional size. Data for this indicator is sourced from Elsevier's Scopus research database, a source-neutral platform curated by independent subject matter experts, ensuring that the data reflects a broad and unbiased view of research impact. Before the citation counts are used, several adjustments are made: first, only specific types of academic papers are included while others, such as abstracts, reports, or conference reviews, are excluded according to predefined criteria. In addition, self-citations—citations where authors reference their own work—are removed to ensure that the indicator captures only external academic recognition. Finally, a normalization process is applied across the institution's key faculty areas, with each area contributing equally to the final score. This rigorous methodology results in a composite measure that reflects not only the quantity but also the quality of research, offering insight into how effectively an institution’s faculty is engaging in high-impact, widely recognized scholarship.

International Faculty

The International Faculty Ratio indicator measures the proportion of academic staff at an institution who are considered international based on their citizenship, compared to the overall number of faculty members. It is calculated by dividing the number of international faculty—those contributing to academic teaching or research for at least three months a year—by the total faculty count. Data is gathered both from institutional submissions and third-party sources, such as government ministries and web data, with cross-checking to ensure its authenticity. The definition of ‘international’ is based on citizenship: for instance, in European Union countries, all foreign nationals, including those from other EU states, are considered international; in Hong Kong SAR, faculty from Mainland China fall under this category; and in cases of dual citizenship, the citizenship acquired by birth or the first passport held is used. Visiting international faculty who are affiliated with another institution are excluded from this measure. A higher international faculty ratio indicates that an institution is successful in attracting a diverse and globally representative academic staff, which can enhance its research, teaching quality, and international collaborations, while also signaling a positive reputation as a desirable workplace.


International Student

The International Student Ratio (ISR) indicator measures the proportion of international students relative to the entire student population at an institution. This indicator reflects the institution's success in attracting foreign students, which is a strong sign of its global reputation and appeal as a desirable place to study. A high ratio of international students brings benefits that extend beyond academic performance, including enhanced networking opportunities, richer cultural exchanges, and a more diverse learning environment. These benefits can lead to a broader alumni network that spans different regions and contributes to the institution's long-term reputation.

Data for the ISR indicator is collected from multiple sources to ensure its accuracy and reliability. Institutions submit their own data as part of the research process, and this information is corroborated with data from third-party sources, such as government ministries, agencies like the UK Higher Education Statistics Agency, and various web sources. This cross-verification process helps to maintain the integrity of the data used in the rankings.

To calculate the indicator, the total number of international students is divided by the overall student numbers, which include both undergraduate and postgraduate students. International students are defined as foreign nationals who spend at least three months studying at the institution. The definition of "international" is based on citizenship, with specific guidelines such as including all foreign nationals in EU countries, even those from other EU states, and counting students from Mainland China as international in Hong Kong SAR. In cases of dual citizenship, the citizenship acquired by birth or through the first passport is considered. It is also important to note that offshore exchange students and distance learning students are excluded from this calculation.

International Research Network

The International Research Network indicator quantifies an institution’s success in building and maintaining research partnerships with organizations in other countries. It assesses the diversity and strength of these collaborations by focusing on sustained partnerships, which are defined as those that result in three or more joint papers over a five-year period. Data for this measure is obtained from Elsevier’s Scopus research database, a source-neutral platform managed by subject matter experts. For each of the five faculty areas, the process begins by counting the distinct international countries or territories represented in the partnerships, and then dividing that number by the natural logarithm of the distinct count of international partners. This step provides an initial ratio that reflects both the breadth and intensity of the institution’s collaborations. The resulting values are then scaled using min-max normalization to produce scores between 1 and 100 for each faculty area. After obtaining these scaled scores, an average (mean) is computed across the faculty areas, followed by Z-score normalization to standardize the distribution of scores. Finally, the Z-scores are rescaled to form the final composite indicator. This rigorous, multi-step process ensures that the indicator accurately reflects how well an institution engages in international research collaboration, which can enhance its research quality and global academic standing.

Employment Outcomes

Full text explanation:
The Employment Outcomes indicator is designed to capture how effectively an institution prepares its graduates for successful careers and meaningful societal contributions. It combines two key components: Alumni Impact and the Graduate Employment Index. The Alumni Impact metric evaluates an institution’s track record in producing graduates who have gone on to make significant impacts in areas such as business, politics, higher education, and charitable endeavors. This is achieved by analyzing the profiles of more than 82,000 impactful graduates and calculating the share of such alumni at both domestic and global levels. On the other hand, the Graduate Employment Index is derived from the graduate employment rate, which is defined as the percentage of graduates who secure paid, full- or part-time employment within 15 months after graduation. Graduates engaged in voluntary or unpaid work, further study, or who are unavailable for work due to other reasons are excluded. Data for the Graduate Employment Index is gathered from institutional and third-party survey sources, ensuring a response rate of more than 20%, or estimated using banded positions from Employer Reputation if direct data is not available. To combine these two dimensions, the Alumni Impact score is multiplied by the natural logarithm of the Graduate Employment Index. This log-transformation is applied to temper the influence of outliers and ensure that the Graduate Employment Index does not overwhelm the overall score. The resulting composite indicator provides a balanced view of an institution’s ability to foster both employability and lasting societal impact among its graduates.

Sustainability

The Sustainability indicator is designed to assess how effectively an institution is committed to a sustainable future by examining a range of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors. It goes beyond traditional academic metrics by incorporating elements such as on-campus environmental initiatives, diversity and inclusion policies, institutional governance practices, and the broader impact of research that aligns with the United Nations' 17 Sustainable Development Goals. This indicator reflects the dual role of universities—not only as centers of education and research but also as significant employers facing operational sustainability challenges. Data for this indicator is sourced from the standalone QS Sustainability Rankings, which combines information submitted directly by institutions, reputation survey responses collected by QS, and third-party data from organizations like the UN, UNESCO, and the World Bank. By integrating these diverse data points, the Sustainability indicator provides a comprehensive view of how universities are addressing contemporary sustainability challenges. It offers prospective students a unique lens through which to evaluate institutions, highlighting those that are making meaningful strides in fostering a sustainable environment both on campus and in the wider community.

QS Overall Score

The QS Overall Score is a comprehensive metric designed to evaluate an institution’s performance across a broad range of dimensions by aggregating multiple measurements into a single score. This score is built on the idea that different aspects of institutional performance can be grouped into thematic categories known as lenses. Each lens focuses on a specific area of performance and contains one or more indicators, which are individual measures of that area. Within each indicator, there may also be more detailed calculations called metrics that provide further insight.

For example, the Research and Discovery lens, which constitutes 50% of the overall score, includes indicators such as Academic Reputation and Citations per Faculty. Academic Reputation carries a weight of 30% and reflects the perception of academic excellence based on expert opinions, while Citations per Faculty, with a weight of 20%, measures the research impact through citation data. The Employability and Outcomes lens, making up 20% of the overall score, is comprised of indicators like Employer Reputation and Employment Outcomes, weighted at 15% and 5% respectively, and focuses on the career success of graduates. The Global Engagement lens contributes 15% to the overall score and includes measures like International Faculty Ratio, International Research Network, and International Student Ratio, which highlight the institution’s ability to attract global talent and foster international research collaborations. The Learning Experience lens, weighted at 10%, is represented by the Faculty Student Ratio indicator, a measure that reflects the level of academic support available to students. Finally, the Sustainability lens, contributing 5% to the overall score, evaluates an institution’s commitment to environmental, social, and governance initiatives.

The overall score is calculated by first assessing each indicator using its own methodology and then applying the respective weightings to reflect its importance. These weighted indicator scores are combined to form the QS Overall Score, which provides a balanced and multifaceted view of an institution’s performance. The weightings for each lens and indicator are reviewed annually to ensure that the ranking remains up-to-date with evolving priorities in higher education.

Not all higher education institutions are eligible for inclusion in the World University Rankings, and among those that are eligible, not all are ranked. To be eligible, an institution must offer full-degree programmes at both undergraduate and postgraduate levels, provide full-degree programmes in at least two faculty areas and in at least two subjects within each faculty area, have a minimum of three graduated classes in each subject, and deliver all or part of each programme on campus. For inclusion in the rankings, an institution must be in the top 20% globally for Academic Reputation, have at least 100 papers indexed and published by Scopus over a five-year period, and, for certain regions (Asia, Arab Region, Europe, and Latin America and the Caribbean), be ranked in its respective regional ranking. Additionally, for smaller institutions with fewer than 5000 students, specific criteria apply—such as ranking in the top 1000 globally for at least one of Academic Reputation, Employer Reputation, or Citations per Faculty; in the top 900 in two of these indicators; or in the top 800 for one indicator.

All institutions are invited to submit data through the QS HUB platform, ensuring that the rankings are as accurate as possible. When data is not directly submitted, institutions may still be featured based on proprietary, publicly available, or previously supplied information. The data reporting period generally covers the academic year preceding the ranking cycle—January to December for the Southern Hemisphere and August to July for the Northern Hemisphere, with certain exceptions noted in the data dictionary.
